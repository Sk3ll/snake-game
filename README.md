A simple Snake Game built with React and TypeScript, featuring a canvas-based game board and dynamic scoring.

## Overview
This classic Snake Game allows players to control a snake, navigate it around the game board, and collect food to grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game board boundaries.

## Features
Next.js and TypeScript: The game is built using Next.js for the user interface and TypeScript for enhanced type safety.

Canvas Rendering: The game board and snake are rendered using the HTML5 Canvas element, providing a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

Dynamic Scoring: Players earn points for each food item consumed, and the game's speed increases every 200 points, adding an extra challenge.

Collision Detection: The game includes collision detection logic to ensure proper handling when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

Clone the repository to your local machine.
